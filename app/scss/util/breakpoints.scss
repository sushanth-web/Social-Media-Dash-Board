/* @mixin is like a function we created a mixin named breakpoint just like a function it also has parameters we created a 
parameter to the mixin called $size. @mixin genrally loads reusable code you wanna use again we create it with keyword @mixin
when inside mixin is the code you dont wanna type in everytime. inside mixin we created a media query min width so it runs when 
the width reaches the specified min width and to get the min width from the specified breakpoints above the mixin we used a method
called map-get so it gets the specified min width,the first parameter in this method is breakpoints-up so it takes the min width 
values from breakpoints-up which we have specifies above and the second parameter is size which takes the size from breakpoints-up and stores 
it as min-width the size indicates small,large,xlarge and its value. @content is the content you wanna run when the webpage reaches the psecified size */

// using mixin 
/* h1{
    @include breakpoint(large){
        font-size: 3rem;
    }
}//so when the size of page reaches the min-width large i.e, 64em h1's font size becomes 3rem
//example of how the above code would look like if it was in normal css
@media(min-width:64em){
    h1{
        font-size: 3rem;
    }
} */
