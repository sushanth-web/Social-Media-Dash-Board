//it is a function that converts pixels to rems we defined a function named rem which has two parameters pixels and context which is already set to value 16
//and the funciton returns the parameter user gives which is in pixels and returns pixels divided by 16 multiplied by 1 rem
//because we all know that on rem is equal to 16 pixels

//implementing the function
/* h1{
    font-size: rem(32);//we have given input as 32 pixels which is 2 rems
}
//what it is going to look like in normal css
h1{
    font-size: 2rem;
